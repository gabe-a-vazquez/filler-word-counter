# SpeechAI

<img src="public/demo.png" alt="SpeechAI Demo" width="600"/>

A full-stack web application that leverages AI and real-time speech processing to help users improve their public speaking skills. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Firebase.

## üß† Filler Word Detection Methodology

Our application employs an advanced embedding-based approach to detect filler words in real-time speech:

1. **Text Embedding**: Using the Supabase/gte-small model from Hugging Face, we convert spoken words into high-dimensional vector representations
2. **Few-Shot Semantic Search**: Each word is compared against a curated set of examples for both filler and meaningful words using semantic similarity
3. **Real-time Processing**: Analysis happens in a dedicated Web Worker to ensure smooth performance
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Each detection includes a confidence score to minimize false positives
5. **Performance Tracking**: Results are logged and analyzed through LangSmith for continuous improvement

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights

- **Real-time Speech Processing**: Implemented streaming speech recognition with WebSocket connections and Web Workers for non-blocking performance
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Next.js 13 App Router, featuring server-side analytics and client-side real-time updates
- **AI Integration**: Utilized Transformers.js for text analysis and Deepgram API for accurate speech-to-text conversion
- **Full-stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety across the entire application
- **Secure Payment Infrastructure**: Integrated Stripe with webhook handling for subscription management
- **NoSQL Database Design**: Structured Firebase collections for efficient user data and analytics storage
- **Authentication & Security**: Implemented Firebase Auth with secure role-based access control
